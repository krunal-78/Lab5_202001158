## Static Analysis:

→ Static analysis is a method of examining the source code of a software program without executing it. Static analysis can help detect errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other quality issues in the code. Static analysis tools can perform various tasks such as checking syntax, style, logic, data flow, control flow, and security. Static analysis can improve the reliability, performance, and maintainability of software by identifying and correcting defects early in the
development process.

## Static Analysis Tools:


→ Static analysis tools are software tools that analyze the source code of a program without executing it. They can help developers find and fix errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and other quality issues in their code. Static analysis tools can also measure various metrics of the code, such as complexity, readability, maintainability, test coverage, and documentation. Static analysis tools can be integrated into the development process as part of the code editor, the version control system, or the continuous integration pipeline. Some examples of static analysis tools are SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, and Pylint.

→ We will use the mypy tool for static analysis of random git repository.

→ The reference git repository link that we are using : 

https://github.com/UltiRequiem/python-projects-for-intermediates/tree/main/library-management-system

## Installation of the Static Analysis Tool : 

→ First of all we will install the mypy tool using the command line : **python -m pip install mypy**

→ To find errors in the repository we will use the following command : **python -m mypy <file_path>**

 The following are the screenshots of how static analysis is performed using mypy tool : 

**Step 1** : First clone the repository.

**Step 2** : Then run the above command for finding errors.

→ Here , we can see that in the repository , there is library-management-system and these are the errors in the AddBook.py file.

→ Similarly , the following are the screenshots of the other files’ static analysis : 

→ Errors in DeleteBook.py file :

→ Errors in IssueBook.py file : 

![image3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77279344/225575702-54637a28-acf8-40b8-9466-13b78383c73a.png)

→ Errors in ReturnBook.py file : 

![image7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77279344/225575692-01fca8bb-765d-46d2-a86a-0b196a6121eb.png)

→ Errors in Main.py file : 

![image5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77279344/225575709-acb5eb2a-e76c-40e0-94ef-afafa85992b8.png)

→ Here , there are no errors in the UpdateBook.py so it is showing no issues found .


## Analysis of the Tool (mypy) : 

→ Mypy is an open-source static type checker for Python.

→ It can check for common type-related errors such as typing mistakes, invalid method calls, and incorrect argument types.

→ It displays a comment which is almost able to define the error and is also understandable which helps in debugging the code.

→ Using mypy one can improve code quality, reduce bugs, and make code easier to understand and maintain.
